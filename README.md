# crogul-prototype
Capture the opponent's zone while defending your own - a 2-player prototype made with pygame

You play as team Crows versus team Seagulls - the white square controls with the WASD keys and the black square controls with the arrow keys.
Your goal is to move to your capture zone (same coloured square on the opposite side) while avoiding contact with your opponent.
You can defend by tagging your opponent which will send you both back to spawn.
The goal is to have the most points for your team (displayed in the console.)
This prototype may eventually have classes with different buffs, items, running + stamina, more players.
